# remote-audio3

This repository cointains a simple example of how to use the SDL2 Haskell bindings to play sound files (as a complete Stack setup with dependencies, because that was most of the hassle) 

See the [PlaySound2](https://github.com/Qqwy/Haskell-sound-playing/blob/master/src/PlaySound2.hs) module for the sound playing implementation, and [Lib.hs](https://github.com/Qqwy/Haskell-sound-playing/blob/master/src/Lib.hs) for example usage.
